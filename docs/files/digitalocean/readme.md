### To Create a DigitalOcean Account

Browse to the [DigitalOcean WebPage](https://m.do.co/c/902b9dbb0402) and select 'Sign up':

From here you will be asked to Create an Account. Before you do this, ensure you already have
a [GitHub](../github/readme.md) Account, and select the 'Sign up with GitHub' option:

![create account](../../images/digitalocean/DO_create_account.png)

You will then be asked to Authorise your connectivity to GitHub, this works best if you have GitHub open and logged in
from another tab in your web browser.

Once you have authorised your account with GitHub, you will be asked to verify your account, for now just select the
'Verify your identity later' option:
